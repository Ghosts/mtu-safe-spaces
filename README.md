## Inspiration

Lack of readily available resources to find gender neutral restrooms, safe spaces, and be weary of unsafe businesses or institutions can make life difficult for members and allies of the LGBTQ+ community. 

## What it does

Safe MTU helps students feel safe, meet like minded people, and get to know their community better by disseminating information and providing useful maps & resources to learn more about MTU's community. 

## How we built it

Safe MTU is built as a static information website using Bootstrap, JS, HTML5, and similar web technologies, all served from a self-hosted lighttpd server.

## Challenges we ran into

Finding and categorizing the map points and resources took the most time, especially when the information is not readily available. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The site is mobile friendly and provides an easy to use interface for students and community members.
## What we learned

## What's next for Safe MTU
